              <h3>What is Flod?</h3>
              <p>
                Flod is an open source, distributed, continuous integration
                system. It employs agents to perform build, test and other
                functions. It is very low friction, and nearly invisible.

                Flod is designed to augment single- or multi-platform software
                projects by providing a framework that automatically builds and
                tests projects without any intervention beyond a single command
                to set up the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Flod provides a means for small to medium software projects to
                enjoy the benefits of continuous integration and multi-platform
                testing without necessarily having dedicated hardware or
                resources.  It is designed around the fact that projects may not
                have continuous access to hardware and may perform testing on
                virtual machines which are not always running.  This is the
                reality of modern systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                One important aspect of flod is that it supports the notion of a
                community of volunteers that can donate cpu time for their
                chosen platform.  This allows more people to contribute to a
                project, providing valuable diagnostics, without the need to be
                able to patch the source code.

                Flod makes every effort to allow this kind of use, which
                includes restrictions on which projects are supported, and
                limiting activity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The name 'flod' means many things: river, flow, flood.  This
                refers to the streams of information that flow into the
                software.
              </p>

            <div>

              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
              <p>
                There are three parts to consider, and each has a special role.
                There is the
                <a href="central.html">central node</a>
                that is a server which coordinates the testing effort and
                aggregates results.  There is a
                <a href="dev.html">dev node</a>
                that provides information about code changes to central.  Lastly
                there is the
                <a href="satellite.html">satellite node</a>
                that does the building and testing.  Here is an overview of this
                arrangement:
              </p>
              <img src="flod-overview.png" />
              <p>
                The diagram shows that all nodes need access to the central
                node.

                The diagram is also for a simple project that involves only a
                single platform, and therefore one satellite.  Even so, this is
                a very useful setup.  A more typical example includes multiple
                satellites, building and testing on each.
              </p>
              <img src="flod-arch.png" />
              <p>
                This represents three satellites, each with its own scratch
                space.

                Central has a work area that stores permanent results and the
                work queue.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a code change is made and committed to the SCM system, a
                hook is triggered that makes a call to flod that looks like
                this:
              </p>
              <pre>
flod build --branch v1.2.3 \
           --commit a0443eacbcbfb133123a9776d6b \
           --author Alice \
           --timestamp 1234567890</pre>
              <p>
                This command communicates with central and provides all the
                information necessary for a satellite to build and test the
                project.  Central records the information.  This all happens
                very quickly, and the code committer will not notice any delay.
                The committer then continues to work, unimpeded by flod.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, the three satellites will ask central if there is any work
                to be done.  In doing this, the satellites provide information
                about the environment on the satellite machine, such as compiler
                version, POSIX compliance, size of a C 'int' type and so on.
                The satellites have a delay between asking central for work,
                which defaults to once a minute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Central will process these work requests by consulting the work
                queue and matching the work against the satellite.  If a match
                is found, the work details are sent back to the satellites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the satellite receives the work, the project is copied,
                built and tested, then the result logs are submitted to central
                for storage and analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Central has hooks that can be used to (re)generate various
                reports on receipt of data from satellites.  The hooks can
                trigger other programs that, for example, create dev snapshot
                tarballs, check for clean builds and clean test runs and so on.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <a name="donate"></a>
              <h3>Use Case: Donating Resources to a Project</h3>
              <p>
                You can donate testing resources to a project, by running a
                satellite node only.  This means that your installation would
                connect to a remote
                <a href="central.html">central node</a>
                and perform builds at its request.  

                This is a valuable way to contribute to a project and Flod
                provides you with a feature to allow you to control and limit
                involvement.
              </p>

              <h3>Use Case: Hosting Your Own Project</h3>
              <p>
                You can also host your own continuous integration system, which
                means you will run a
                <a href="central.html">central node</a>,
                a
                <a href="dev.html">dev node</a>,
                and one or more
                <a href="satellite.html">satellite nodes</a>.
              </p>
